# Automation Exercise Testing Project

## 📌 About
A Selenium automation testing project for the [Automation Exercise website](https://automationexercise.com/),  
built with **Java**, **TestNG**, and **Maven**, following the **Page Object Model (POM)** design pattern.  
This project is fully authored and implemented by me as a fresh tester to practice professional standards in test automation.  
It is integrated with **Allure Reports** for advanced test reporting.
